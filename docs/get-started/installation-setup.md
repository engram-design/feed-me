Installing Feed Me is as simple as any other Craft plugin - just drop the `feedme` folder in your `craft/plugins` directory and install.

## Installation

1. [Download the latest version](/craft-plugins/feed-me/pricing) of Feed Me and unzip.
2. Copy the `feedme/` directory into your `craft/plugins/` directory.
3. Inside the Craft control panel, navigate to _Settings â†’ Plugins_.
4. Locate the row showing the Feed Me plugin and click _Install_.

- **Enabled tabs** - you can enable/disable any tabs in the Feed Me plugin section.
- **Clear pending tasks** - allowing you to clear out any stuck tasks.

# Troubleshooting

### Performance

If you're experiencing slow processing for your feed, try the following:

- Turn off `devMode`. Craft's built-in logging when devMode is switched on will greatly slow down the import process, and causes a high degree of memory overhead.
- Consider turning on the `checkExistingFieldData` [configuration setting](/craft-plugins/feed-me/docs/get-started/configuration#configuration-options) to prevent unnecessary content overwriting.
- Consider selecting the Add Entries option for duplication handling, depending on your requirements.
- Consider turning off the Backup option for the feed. This will depend on your specific circumstances.
- Opt for a JSON feed - there is significantly less processing overhead as opposed to XML.

You may also need to adjust the `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time` values in your php.ini file if you run into memory issues.

### Unexpected Results

If you're experiencing unexpected results when running an import, try to isolate the issue by selectively mapping fields until you have a bare-minimum import.

For example, if you're mapping 20+ fields for an Entry import, but it isn't working, try to map just the Title field, and work your way through mapping additional fields until things stop working as expected.

### Logging

Feed Me create a log event for just about everything it does, notably errors, but other useful information. If you're experiencing issues or unexpected results with a Feed, consult the [Logs](/craft-plugins/feed-me/docs/support/troubleshooting/logging) first.

### Debugging

You can run the [debug](/craft-plugins/feed-me/docs/support/troubleshooting/debugging) action to show an output of data before being mapped to an Element. This is particularly useful in checking what Feed Me plans to map to your Elements before import.

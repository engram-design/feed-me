# FAQs

### How does licensing work?

A Feed Me Pro license is valid for a single installation of Craft. If you want to use it on more than one site, you'll need to purchase additional licenses.

### Can I import content into a specific Locale?

Yes. When setting up your feed, you're able to [select the locale](/craft-plugins/feed-me/docs/feature-tour/creating-your-feed#locales) you want to import your feed content into. This will import your content into only this Locale, leaving others untouched.

For multiple Locale's, you'll need to create a feed for each locale.
